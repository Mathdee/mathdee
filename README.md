### Journey into Code 🎨➡️💻

My path to programming wasn't conventional! I started with a love for 2D animation, which quickly evolved into crafting 3D worlds in Blender (you can still find some of my creations on [YouTube](YOUR_YOUTUBE_CHANNEL_URL_HERE)!). Wanting to bring those 3D creations to life, I dived into Unity and game development – and that's where I wrote my first lines of code. I was instantly hooked by the power to build, solve, and create. Now, I'm driven by the desire to develop software that makes a real difference.

### 🚀 What I'm Building & Dreaming Up

Here's a glimpse into my current coding adventures and an idea I'm super excited about:

* 🤖 **SelfView**: An interview simulation platform (React, TS, Python) helping developers practice and shine. Currently working on integrating TensorFlow & OpenAI API for some smart feedback!
* 🎮 **CodeCobra**: Making learning Data Structures & Algorithms fun with an interactive Snake game (React.js, JS Canvas, Firebase). Who knew linked lists could be this engaging?
* 🌳 **Arbortag (Future Project!)**: Imagine scanning a tree with your phone and instantly learning about it! I envision Arbortag replacing those little info boards, using tech to help us connect more deeply with nature and our surroundings. (If this sparks an idea, let's chat!)

### 🌱 Let's Create Together!

I'm passionate about bringing innovative ideas to life, big or small. If you have an interesting challenge, a **short-term micro-project**, or an idea that could use a creative coder's touch, I'd love to explore it with you! I particularly enjoy:

* **Automating the Mundane:** Turning repetitive web tasks into efficient Python scripts (Selenium, Pandas).
* **Web Magic:** Polishing JS/React sites with bug fixes, performance boosts, or neat new features.
* **AI Sparks:** Building small-scale AI tools or simple intelligent agents (Python, TensorFlow, OpenAI API).
* **Full-Stack Snippets:** Adding that one missing piece with React/Node.js or Python & Firebase.
* **Data Storytelling:** Cleaning datasets and crafting simple, insightful visualizations (Python, Pandas, NumPy).
* **Code Detective Work:** Debugging and optimizing code in Python, JS, Java, or C++.
* **Seeing with Code:** Tackling small image processing tasks using OpenCV.

My approach is practical, communicative, and I aim for a quick turnaround on well-defined tasks.

### ✨ Beyond the Code

When I'm not immersed in lines of code, you'll likely find me:
* 🏄‍♂️ **Surfing:** Catching waves is my way to clear my head and connect with nature.
* 🛠️ **Building Things (IRL!):** From chicken coops to treehouses, I love creating with my hands.
* 🏀 Playing sports with friends.

### 🔭 What's Next on My Learning Radar?

With Python as my trusty sidekick, I'm super curious about:
* ☁️ **Cloud Computing (GCP & others)**
* 🧠 **Machine Learning & AI** - always more to explore here!
I believe in lifelong learning, so I'm always ready to jump on any opportunity to learn something new and impactful.
